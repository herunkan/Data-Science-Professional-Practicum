## 🔬 Key Concepts

### CleanML Framework
CleanML is a comprehensive study investigating how different data cleaning methods affect machine learning model performance. The research explores:

- **Data Quality Issues**: Missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, duplicates, and mislabeled data
- **Cleaning Methods**: Various imputation, normalization, and deduplication techniques
- **ML Pipeline Impact**: How cleaning choices propagate through feature engineering, model training, and evaluation

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the relationship between data quality and ML performance
2. Analyze trade-offs between different data cleaning strategies
3. Recognize that "cleaner" data doesn't always mean better model performance
4. Learn systematic approaches to evaluate data cleaning methods

## 📚 Key Findings from CleanML

- Data cleaning impact varies significantly across ML models
- Some models (e.g., tree-based) are more robust to certain data quality issues
- The interaction between cleaning methods and model types is non-trivial
- Systematic benchmarking is essential for choosing optimal cleaning strategies
